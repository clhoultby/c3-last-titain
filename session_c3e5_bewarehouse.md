## Drunken Dragon 

El and Aranris confront Odecha in his room.  With a lot of reluctance Odecha describes why he came to work in Oma;
- head a voice in his head offtering work, 
- traveled to Oma 
- met Ambrose, leader of  Mind's Edge (or head of recruitment)
- Was tested via mind reading & truth serum 
- First job is to transport goods to a location north of the lords wood, the slums, tomorrow morning. 

El & A promise protection; El stays at Drunk & Aranris heads back to rest of the group 


## Small talk 
- KPV is from Aglos, Kol, exo temple 
- OFY is from: Aglos, Brielaith 
- Hoot's Tourettes doesn't affect him while singing/calm 


## Raid the Warehouse
Seeing the guards lock up for the day party raids the warehouse. After triggering guard dog, fight ensues.
- 2 Dog like constructs & 1 (human?) guard
- Aranris takes a hammering 
- KPV leaps in to draw them away and uses wings(!) to fly around the warehouse
- KPV is KO'd and almost killed

## Post Fight 
- Aldrick revies KPV, 
- Aranris murmers: Too weak (paraphrase) "...Can't help the people of Lococia"
- KPV loots chest and gets magic gloves and a book containing a list of names (missed details on this part, but I assume it was the list of names of missing people)
- Ofly: finds a massive chest of refined resdiuum, implying huge well funded smuggling operation 

## Drunken Dragon 
El overhears a vistor to Odecha
- Timeline for goods transportation job planned for the next day has been moved up
