Only started to be able to use magic since being grafted the arm 

Titans are the genesys creation story:
- material created by titans
- emotions gifted by the gods

- arm was lost ~2 years ago
- was previously mundane, can now wield magic through arm, but can't control it. Arm is conduit/amplifier for magic?

- Father has relationship with Igigan Ushi (lecturer from Oma University)
