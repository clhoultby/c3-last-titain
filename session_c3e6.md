## Elendar tails goon
- Elendar tails the man who told Odheca the transport time had changed all the way to the slums
- Saw him use secret entrance near the tree at the edge of the slums/city wall
- Steamwise solutions is actually near to this secret entrance

## Small talk
- Hoots says to Elendar he's suspicious that one of our group is an owl
- Ofeliya managed to get a free room at the drunken dragon by 'coercing' the barmaid
- Aranris asked about Elendar's connection with Hoots and he just said they'd both been hired by Xaltor

## Town crier
- A town crier is heard talking about a building having been burned down near the Golden Griffin (presumably warehouse)

## Slums
- The group split up to infiltrate the slums, half went through secret door and over did the non lethal takedown of the guard
- Group found a building guarded by a group of teens which Ofeliya basically intimidated into wetting themselves
