### Hoots & Aranis Conversation in Laughing Gnome C3S3
Elendar has been a good friend to Hoots and is the first one to coin the name Hoots

Hoots has vague memories of childhood.

"Elisted in army, last memory is of a mission outside the city, of dark woodlands, 
Constriction,
rope, 
pain everywhere!"

"Been searching for his people and what happened to him since"
