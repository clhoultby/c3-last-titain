# Aranris Mistarelthwin

 Elf Ranger hired as a bodyguard to Xaltor Nalvash.



 ## Dream
 Started campaign with a dream about a trial in which he was exiled.  Other person on trial appeared to be his brother.  
 Father may or may not have been on the panel that exiled him; at the least a person of importance that could have intervened in the trial but did not. 
 
 - Exiled from where?
 - What was his crime?
 - Where brother now?
